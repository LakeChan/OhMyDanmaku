# OhMyDanmaku
A Simple Desktop Danmaku System

# Get Start
### Build
OhMyDanmaku is based on WPF, which means you need .NET Framework 3.5 or higher.

### How to Send Danmaku

OhMyDanmaku listen on `localhost:8585` with `UDP` by default.

Send string data in **UTF-8** to listener, then a danmaku will across screen like a bullet

Also, you can use reverse proxy to handle the communication, there is a sample in `src/WebProxySample`

# Customize
Danmaku style(color,size,time,etc..) and listen port can change in setting menu very easily

Or just modify the code :)
